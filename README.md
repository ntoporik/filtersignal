# filtersignal

This program finds the discrete fourier transform on an input signal, bandpass filters around a target frequency, and fft's on the pass band.
Filters available are butterworth bandpass and butterworth low pass.
The program uses numpy, scipy, and matplotlib

Its pretty straightforward, but let me know if there are any questions or comments
